**farvic/farvic** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My journey as a developer did not start with a "Hello World". In fact, it all started when I decided do create a Ragnarok Online game server. There I had my first contact with PHP, MySQL, Apache and C. I learned how to write my first script looking for patterns in the files of other NPC's (Non-Player Character).
